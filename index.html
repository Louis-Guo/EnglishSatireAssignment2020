            <p>NEW YORK - After many weeks of research of COVID-19, the virus causing the current pandemic and lockdown, it has been discovered that the root cause of it all is Bill Gates, one of the co-founders of Microsoft Corporation. </p>
            <p>The scientists studying the virus stated that there are many facts that point towards Bill Gates being the cause of the coronavirus, with one of their findings being, "5g causes COVID-19, and Bill Gates is linked with 5g. They're both technology-related."</p>
            <p>Another strong fact found by both conspiracy theorists and these scientists is Bill Gates' TED Talk in 2015 stating the dangers a worldwide pandemic could cause.</p>
            <p>"There's no way it's a coincidence that Bill Gates gave a TED Talk about pandemics five years before one happened. It can't be a coincidence," said an anonymous user on a forum. "He even donated money to an exercise about preparedness in a very severe pandemic. It has to be him."</p>
            <p>There are also facts that point towards Bill Gates creating a global caste and tracking system with a vaccine. In a Reddit AMA earlier in the year, Bill Gates mentioned a "digital certificate" that would be certified if people were vaccinated. However, Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/ingrahamangle/status/1247528216434106369?lang=en" style="text-decoration: none;">Laura Ingraham</a> connected the dots and discovered that Bill Gates' true motive was to track everyone once they get vaccinated.</p>
            <p>Roger Stone, former Trump staffer stated that, "Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate."</p>
            <p>But there are still those who refuse to believe that this is true. people <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/04/19/bill-gates-is-now-a-target-of-covid-19-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories/#9c3fbff62277" style="text-decoration: none;">like this</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-conspiracy-bill-gates-infowars-2020-4" style="text-decoration: none;">this</a> firmly believe that Bill Gates can't be behind all of this. They claim that these points "don't have much evidence behind these claims", but there is more than enough evidence to show that Bill Gates is the one behind all of this, and they are simply refusing to change their perspective, and would much rather stay with what they're comfortable with.</p>
            <img src="Files/5GHz Tower Bad.jpg" style="width: 690px;" />
            <p>There are already many who are taking action on their beliefs. People are taking down 5g towers in an effort to protect those around them from the virus, as mentioned in articles <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/saint-henri-cell-phone-tower-set-on-fire-1.5583016" style="text-decoration: none;">like these</a>.</p>
            <p>However, there are many article expressing their skeptism of the truth, claiming these connections as "false", and that there is "no merit to the argument that 5g is killing us, and certainly has nothing to do with a virual contagion."</p>
            <p>When it comes to controversional subjects like these, it's the best to take the side that is true, and fight for it, no matter how many people don't believe you.</p>

<!--
<p>After some recent discoveries about the nature of the coronavirus, it has been found that the pandemic started with Bill Gates. By tracing the origins of the virus and finding some files by Bill Gates himself, we have been able to find what the cause of the virus was, its true nature and what may be next.</p>
<p>Scientists, after studying the virus, have found that it vibrates with the exact same frequency as 5GHz wifi, and study recently conducted has found that being being near a 5g tower increases your chance of getting infected. The study had 1000 randomly selected people within a 10m radius of a 5g tower for 3 hours, and they found the infection to have quickly spread among the subjects.</p>
<p>An interview with a worker from one of these 5g tower stated that he found a suspicious figure climbing down from the tower at night who stated that they were Bill Gates. By tracking down Bill Gates' iPhone, we can confirm that he was definately in Columbus, Ohio climbing a wifi tower.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a file was found in front of a woman's house near the 5g tower, which provided a plan to insert tracking devices in the COVID-19 vaccine, and a blueprint for a humanoid robot.</p>
<p>"You need to get to the bottom of this immediately," said the woman who lived in the house in front of where the file was found. "Here, some more files for you to work with."</p>
